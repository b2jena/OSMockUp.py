This is a basic operating system mock-up made from python GUI module tkinter. It has a few interactive apps to navigate through.
There are 2 main screens, apart from the various app screens. At first, you're confronted with the welcome screen, where you're supposed to enter your password within 5 tries. On login, you enter the app drawer, where you can choose from a grid of apps.
